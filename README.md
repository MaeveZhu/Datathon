# Modecraft Analytics
Deployed Link: https://maevezhu.github.io/Datathon/

## Project Overview
This project was originally for a Datathon. 
In this project, we are given a raw database of the yearly sales of an online retail company called Modecraft. To enhance their sales performance and inform future sales strategies, we utilized tools such as SQL Server, Python, HTML, and Tableau to clean and sort the data.
